Insertion sort -
	Insertion sort works fast on small values.
	Insertion sort grows really fast so it's a lot less effective in dealing with long values compared to merge sort.
	Insertion sort basically finds the correct possition by comparing the current value with the next value to find
	the correct possition for our current value.
	If our current value is greater than the one behind, it compares our current value with the previous and repeats
	this until it gets to the place where either no values are left, or the possition is found.

	| 5 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 1 | 3 |
	2 > 5? <<;
	| 2 | 5 | 4 | 6 | 1 | 3 |
	...
	| 2 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 1 | 3 |
	               1 > 6?
			1 > 5?
		  1 > 4?
	   1 > 2? <<;
	| 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 3 |

	pseudocode:
	
	for j = 2 to A.lenght
	key = A[j]
	i = j - 1
	while i > 0 and A[i] > key
		A[i + 1] = A[i]
		i = i - 1
	A[i + 1] = key
